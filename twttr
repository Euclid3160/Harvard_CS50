# When texting or tweeting, itâ€™s not uncommon to shorten words to save time or space, as by omitting vowels, 
# much like Twitter was originally called twttr. In a file called twttr.py, 
# implement a program that prompts the user for a str of text and then outputs that same text but with all vowels (A, E, I, O, and U) omitted, 
# whether inputted in uppercase or lowercase.
