# implement a program that prompts the user for an arithmetic expression and then calculates 
# and outputs the result as a floating-point value formatted to one decimal place. Assume 
# that the userâ€™s input will be formatted as x y z, with one space between x and y and one space between y and z, wherein:
#
#    x is an integer
#    y is +, -, *, or /
#    z is an integer
#
#For instance, if the user inputs 1 + 1, your program should output 2.0. Assume that, if y is /, then z will not be 0.
# For my code I swapped the values of y and z.
