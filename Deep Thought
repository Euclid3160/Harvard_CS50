# Assignment: implement a program that prompts the user for the answer to the Great Question of Life, the Universe and Everything, 
# outputting Yes if the user inputs 42 or (case-insensitively) forty-two or forty two. Otherwise output No.

# I took some liberties and changed up the questions and answers a bit, but kept the spirit of the assignment. 

def main():
    answer = input("What is the answer to the universe? ").lower().strip()
    if answer == "42" or answer == "forty two" or answer == "forty-two":
        correct()
    else:
        print("That is incorrect, try again young one.")
        main()

def correct():
    print("That is correct, carry on wise one.")
