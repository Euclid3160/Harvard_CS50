# implement a program that prompts the user for a time and outputs whether it’s breakfast time, lunch time, or dinner time. 
# If it’s not time for a meal, don’t output anything at all. Assume that the user’s input will be formatted in 24-hour time 
# as #:## or ##:##. And assume that each meal’s time range is inclusive. For instance, whether it’s 7:00, 7:01, 7:59, or 8:00, 
# or anytime in between, it’s time for breakfast.

# Structure your program per the below, wherein convert is a function (that can be called by main) that converts time, a str in 24-hour format, 
# to the corresponding number of hours as a float. For instance, given a time like "7:30" 
# (i.e., 7 hours and 30 minutes), convert should return 7.5 (i.e., 7.5 hours).

def main():
    meal = input("What time is it? (use 24 hour format) ")
    meal = convert(meal)
    
    if 7.00 <= meal <= 8.00:
        print("It's breakfast time!")
    elif 12.00 <= meal <= 13.00:
        print("It's lunch time!")
    elif 18.00 <= meal <= 19.00:
        print("It's dinner time!")
    else:
        print("It's not meal time yet!")

def convert(time):
    time = time.split(":")
    time[1]  = int(time[1])/60
    time = float(time[0]) + time[1]
    
    return time

main()
